**For more information check out the website and** [Enter The Void](https://automathematical.github.io/EnterTheVoid/) 	:hole: :see_no_evil:	:speak_no_evil:	:hear_no_evil:	

## How to get started
This project is built using [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), so you'll need to install it first

1. Clone or download
2. Open the solution (EnterTheVoid/EnterTheVoid/EnterTheVoid.sln) in visual studio
3. Build the solution (right click on Solution 'EnterTheVoid' -> Build Solution)
4. The Grasshopper library (GHA) file is configured to build to ```\EnterTheVoid\EnterTheVoid\bin``` You'll need to copy it to your Grasshopper components directory, or use GrasshopperDeveloperSettings command to tell Grasshopper to look in your /debug/ directory for the assembly.
