**The Void** <br/>
*"The manifestation of nothingness is closely associated with the contemplation of emptiness, and with human attempts to identify and personify it. As such, the concept of the void, and ideas similar to it, have a significant historically evolving presence in artistic and creative expressions, as well in academic, scientific and philosofical debates around the nature of the human condidition."*

This creative project is an endeavour to define this metaphysical concept of the Void. It takes an architectural approach constraining the concept with the same boundaries the human condition is bound to, thus painting it in threedimensional space. Every iteration connects one dot to another. Every time a new starting point is given a new network is created seeking to define the Void. <br/>

Being a digital project the next step is to materialise this project in "Real Life" at human scale and see if we could Enter The Void.
